# Python Port Scanner 🐍🔍🔒
The Python Port Scanner is a command-line tool that allows you to scan a target host for open ports. It is written in Python 🐍 and uses the sockets module to connect to each port on the target host and check if it is open or closed. The scanner supports scanning a single port, a range of ports, or all ports. It also has the ability to scan multiple hosts in parallel.
